# Java-programs

written summary
describes the project 
skills you mastered
challenges you faced 
what you learned
whatever you think is relevant so that a programmer like Jordan could quickly look through the project and assess it and so that non-programmers (or, rather "former programmers) like Terry and me could read the summary and see what skills you mastered and what you learned.
