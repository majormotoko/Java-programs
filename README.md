# Java-programs
If I've learned one piece of 'sage advice' in learning programming, it is the often-repeated maxim to 'learn one language well first, then progress to others'. My initial foray into coding during my 2nd degree was about half web development (HTML/CSS/JS and related technologies, and half traditional CS material. I think taking 2 semesters of C, the foundation of most modern languages, made learning all subsequent languages easier (JS and Java in particular).

written summary
describes the project 
skills you mastered
challenges you faced 
what you learned
whatever you think is relevant so that a programmer like Jordan could quickly look through the project and assess it and so that non-programmers (or, rather "former programmers) like Terry and me could read the summary and see what skills you mastered and what you learned.
