# Java-programs

The programs here demonstrate the following concepts (among others):
Array Utilites - Static methods, exception handling.
URL String Encoding - Strings (which are Objects in Java).
Array Sort - Objects, Arrays, Sorting methods.
MyTime - 'Getters and Setters', data formatting.
MyUrl - Constructors, method overloading.
URLStringEncode - String methods, using the Java API.
Shapes Folder- Polymorphism, Inheritance, method overloading.

If I've learned one piece of 'sage advice' in learning programming, it is the often-repeated maxim to 'learn one language well first, then progress to others'. My initial foray into coding during my 2nd degree was about half web development (HTML/CSS/JS and related technologies, and half traditional CS material. I think taking 2 semesters of C, the foundation of most modern languages, made learning all subsequent languages easier (JS and Java in particular). At this point I have had exposure to: C, Java/.jsp, ColdFusion, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, JS, scripting in BASH, and a tiny bit of Python. I've looked at a bunch of others.

Although there are discussion boards and weekly chats, the courses are in many ways self-directed. Noone does the reading, and coding projects in many ways an exercise in research, planning, and testing. 
My understanding of OOP has been solidified and given me a base to work from. I can research and use API's, import and modify existing code, wade through textbooks and technical material, and understand the humor in Dilbert and XKCD. Most importantly, I can plan a module of code and write it. Most modern languages are at least semi-intellgible to me, even in the syntax is unfamiliar. 

One of the main reasons I decided to take the school approach (as opposed to self-teaching) was to attempt to absorb 'best practices', which several of my professors have thankfully been merciless to me regarding. I try to adhere to the following principles when writing software (which essentially follow some of the principles of 'Agile Development')
1. Keep it simple. Where a simple, direct solution is possible, use it, rather than an 'elegant, minimal' solution which may be dazzling only to other coders.
2. Keep it neat and readable - use meaningful variable and method names, use commenting which is brief and to the point, and which
describes exactly what the code is doing.
3. Proper use of data abstraction - to provide meaningful and useful models of data, and not to unnecessarily obfuscate them.
4. Proper use of encapsulation - keep client code private from stranger code.
